📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project
📝 Overview

This project showcases a complete data analytics lifecycle, starting from raw data ingestion in Python to delivering insights through SQL analysis, interactive Power BI dashboards, and an executive-level presentation.
The objective is to demonstrate strong capabilities in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL querying, business intelligence, and insight communication.

📂 Dataset

Source: CSV file

Loaded and explored using pandas

Includes customer behavior, transactional details, and demographic attributes

Used to derive business insights and build analytical dashboards

You may update dataset description based on your specific file.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming & Analysis

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Databases

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

Business Intelligence

Power BI (Dashboarding & KPI visualization)

Presentation & Reporting

Gamma App (Final PPT)

Structured analytical report (PDF/Doc)

🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading (Python)

Import dataset using pandas.read_csv()

Inspect columns, data types, and missing values

Conduct initial profiling to understand dataset shape and structure

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and distribution analysis

Univariate & bivariate analysis

Correlation heatmaps

Identification of trends, patterns, and anomalies

Visualizations to understand customer behavior

3. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Correcting inconsistent formatting

Removing duplicates

Standardizing values and creating new derived variables

Preparing dataset for SQL ingestion & BI modelling

4. SQL Analysis

Load cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Execute analytical queries including:

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)

Joins for relational insights

KPI computation such as total spend, average order value, customer segmentation

SQL outputs support the final dashboard and business recommendations

5. Power BI Dashboard Development

Create data model using cleaned data

Build dynamic and interactive dashboard including:

KPI cards

Trend analysis

Customer segmentation visualizations

Filters & slicers

Designed for business stakeholders to explore insights intuitively

6. Insight Report

The formal analytical report summarizes:

EDA findings

SQL-driven insights

Dashboard highlights

Suggested business actions

7. Executive Presentation (Gamma)

Clear, minimalistic slide design

Integrated charts and insights

Business recommendations for decision-makers

📈 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard delivers:

High-level KPIs

Customer behavior patterns

Purchase frequency and category preferences

Geographic & demographic insights

Trend analysis for revenue and engagement

(Add dashboard image or link here once ready.)

🧠 Key Results & Insights

Example insights (replace with your actual results):

Identification of top-performing customer segments

Revenue distribution across demographic groups

Seasonal or monthly purchasing trends

Behavior clusters useful for targeted marketing

Data-driven recommendations to enhance profitability
